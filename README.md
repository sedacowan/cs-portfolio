# CS-250 Travel Program â€“ Agile Project Portfolio

Welcome to my CS-250 Agile Portfolio. This repository contains Java files developed as part of the Agile project for the course, simulating a travel application for a fictional company called Vision Quest. The application was developed using Agile Scrum methodology and includes features like a travel slideshow and a curated list of top five travel destinations.

## Files Included

### 1. Slideshow.java

This file is responsible for simulating a slideshow of travel destinations. It was created to support the visual aspect of the travel program.

**Features:**
- Displays a sequence of destination names or images.
- Can be integrated into a larger GUI or console-based interface.
- Enhances user experience by providing a visual journey.

**Purpose in Project:**
Used as part of the feature demonstration to simulate how users would view highlighted travel locations.

### 2. TopFiveDestinationList.java

This file manages a list of the top five travel destinations chosen for the project.

**Features:**
- Stores destination names in a list.
- Allows retrieval and display of the top destinations.
- Can be modified to support sorting, searching, or updating destinations.

**Purpose in Project:**
Served as the core data structure to reflect team and product owner decisions during Sprint 1 and supported the development of test cases and design mockups.
