# CS-250 Travel Program – Agile Project Portfolio

Welcome to my CS-250 Agile Portfolio. This repository contains Java files and project documentation developed as part of the Agile project for the course, simulating a travel application for a fictional company called Vision Quest. The application was developed using Agile Scrum methodology and includes features like a travel slideshow, a curated list of top five travel destinations, and a written summary of team reflections through Sprint Review and Retrospective documentation.

## Files Included

### 1. Slideshow.java

This file is responsible for simulating a slideshow of travel destinations. It was created to support the visual aspect of the travel program.

**Features:**
- Displays a sequence of destination names or images.
- Can be integrated into a larger GUI or console-based interface.
- Enhances user experience by providing a visual journey.

**Purpose in Project:**
Used as part of the feature demonstration to simulate how users would view highlighted travel locations.

### 2. TopFiveDestinationList.java

This file manages a list of the top five travel destinations chosen for the project.

**Features:**
- Stores destination names in a list.
- Allows retrieval and display of the top destinations.
- Can be modified to support sorting, searching, or updating destinations.

**Purpose in Project:**
Served as the core data structure to reflect product owner decisions during Sprint 1 and supported the development of test cases and design mockups.

### 3. Sprint Review And Retrospective.docx

This is a written document that summarizes the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective for the SNHU Travel project.

**Contents:**
- Analysis of Scrum roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer) and how they were applied.
- Reflection on how user stories were completed and managed through sprints.
- A detailed example of how the team responded to changes in the wireframe and destination list using Agile principles.
- Communication strategies used to maintain alignment and collaboration.
- Evaluation of tools and ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.
- Final thoughts on the effectiveness and challenges of using the Agile Scrum approach in the context of the course project.

**Purpose in Project:**
Serves as a comprehensive reflection and evaluation of the Agile process used in the course project. It demonstrates how Scrum practices were applied, how feedback was integrated, and how the project adapted to evolving requirements, offering a real-world perspective on Agile in action.

## Reflection on Essential Computer Science Questions

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
User needs are interpreted by identifying the core goals they want to achieve and translating those into technical requirements. Creating user stories makes this process easier by framing needs from the user’s perspective and breaking them down into small, actionable tasks. In this project, user stories helped me stay focused on what features mattered most, plan my work more efficiently, and ensure that the functionality I developed aligned with realistic user expectations.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach development with a problem-solving mindset, starting with planning, then designing, coding, testing, and refining. Agile has taught me to embrace iteration and feedback rather than aiming for perfection on the first try. In future projects, I hope to consistently use Agile practices like backlog grooming, iterative development, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. These processes help maintain a steady workflow, encourage collaboration, and lead to higher quality results.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
A good team member communicates openly, supports others, and meets commitments. It also means being adaptable, respectful of different ideas, and focused on the shared goal. Even in individual projects, it’s important to approach work with responsibility and attention to how my contributions would fit within a larger team or product. These skills help ensure long-term project success and readiness for real-world collaboration.
